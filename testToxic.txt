When the campus Wi-Fi crashed again, I muttered, “Are you kidding me? This is bullshit.” I’d been trying to push code for two hours, and the repo kept timing out. “What the hell is wrong with this setup?” My friend shrugged and said to reboot. I did—nothing changed. Another timeout. Another wasted minute. “This is crap,” I snapped. “Who designed this damn network, a freaking potato?”

By the third failure I was pissed. The UI froze, the terminal hung, and my patience evaporated. “Fix your bloody servers already!” I hammered the Enter key like an idiot, knowing it wouldn’t help. A classmate chimed in: “Calm down.” “Calm down? Screw that. I’ve got a deadline.” He smirked. “Maybe your code sucks.” That did it. “Shut the hell up,” I shot back. “I’m tired, I’m hungry, and this stupid network is a freaking nightmare.”

I took a breath, stared at the screen, and noticed a tiny warning: authentication token expired. “You’ve got to be kidding me.” One refresh, one login, and suddenly everything worked. The push went through in seconds. I slumped back, embarrassed. Maybe the system wasn’t the only problem; maybe I’d been a jerk. I messaged the classmate: “Sorry. I was frustrated.” He replied with a thumbs-up and a link to a guide. I bookmarked it, whispered “damn,” and promised myself to read the error messages before yelling at the void next time.
